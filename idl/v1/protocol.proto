// Package agency.v1 is the first version of findy gRPC API. As long as we'll
// not have changes that aren't backward compatible, we can just update the
// API.  The gRPC itself will take care off that, like adding a new fields to
// messages. We just need to follow the gRPC practises and rules.
//
// As said, as long as we can maintain backward compatibility, we are working
// with version 1.0.  The version 2.0 will be introduced when we cannot solve
// something only with the version 1.0. The 2.0 will include all the current
// APIs of 1.0 and we support them both together until the decision shall be
// made to depracate 1.0 totally. The deprecation rules will be specified
// later.

ProtocolService runs and monitors DIDComm protocols. The service handles
protocols as a protocol state machines (PSM). The PSMs are optimized for
performance and stability on high load. They are presistent and consume
resources. Please remember to call Release after protocol is (totally) finalized
i.e. as soon as it's Ready. If state machines aren't released by caller the
agency will release them by force sooner or later.

Protocol is a interface message for ProtocolService.Start/Run. The protocol
message complements e.g. Start function to the following pseudo code:
   ProtocolService.Start(Protocol{TypeId: DIDEXCHANGE, Role: INITIATOR})
which can be read as:
   Start DIDEXCHANGE Protocol as INITIATOR
The DIDComm/Aries protocol is always defined with the protocol's typeID and
together with the role they define how the protocol will be started. The table
below lists few examples.
   Protocol.TypeID        (as)  Role              Meaning
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   DIDEXCHANGE                   INITIATOR         connect to other agent
   ISSUE_CREDENTIAL              ADDRESSEE         request credential
   PRESENT_PROOF                 RESUMER           accept proof request
   BASIC_MESSAGE                 INITIATOR         send basic message

The rest of the fields in Protocol include prev_threadID and connectionID. The
StartMsg fields include typeID specific data.
