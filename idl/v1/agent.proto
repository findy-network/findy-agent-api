// not have changes that aren't backward compatible, we can just update the
// API.  The gRPC itself will take care off that, like adding a new fields to
// messages. We just need to follow the gRPC practises and rules.
//
// As said, as long as we can maintain backward compatibility, we are working
// with version 1.0.  The version 2.0 will be introduced when we cannot solve
// something only with the version 1.0. The 2.0 will include all the current
// APIs of 1.0 and we support them both together until the decision shall be
// made to depracate 1.0 totally. The deprecation rules will be specified
// later.
